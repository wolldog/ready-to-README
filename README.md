  ## Description
  
  The ready-to-README application quickly produces a professional README.md file for use with GitHub projects. 

  A README.md provides users with an overview of the what, why and how of a project and is always written in Markdown.

  ## <a name="installation"></a>Installation
  
  The application requires node.js to be installed. Clone the project folder from GitHub to your local machine. Navigate to the project folder and open a terminal window. Run ‘npm install’ from the command line ensuring you are in the folder with index.js file. This will install the dependencies; inquirer v8.2.4 and node:fs.
  
  ## <a name="usage"></a>Usage

  Type ‘node index.js’ from the command line and answer the series of questions provided. 

  Where an extended response is expected (description, usage), the input requests you open your preferred editor. When you have completed your response, close the    editor. You will be prompted to save your response and your response will be confirmed by displaying ‘Received’ in the terminal input.

  Where a list of options is provided for your response (license) navigate up and down the list using the arrow key on your keyboard and select your chosen option by clicking the space bar.
  
  When all the questions have been answered, a README.md file will be created in the results folder.
